Description: sirplus is a package for the modeling of COVID-19 spread with extensions to the classical Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, using 
    stochastic individual compartment models (ICMs). It provides a simple interface
    for creating experiments to demonstrate how factors like social-distancing and
    epidemiological parameters will change the curve of an epidemic's trajectory.
