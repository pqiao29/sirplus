  abstract = "Package EpiModel provides tools for building, simulating, and
              analyzing mathematical models for the population dynamics of
              infectious disease transmission in R. Several classes of models
              are included, but the unique contribution of this software
              package is a general stochastic framework for modeling the spread
              of epidemics on networks. EpiModel integrates recent advances in
              statistical methods for network analysis (temporal exponential
              random graph models) that allow the epidemic modeling to be
              grounded in empirical data on contacts that can spread infection.
              This article provides an overview of both the modeling tools
              built into EpiModel, designed to facilitate learning for students
              new to modeling, and the application programming interface for
              extending package EpiModel, designed to facilitate the
              exploration of novel research questions for advanced modelers.",
