# sirplus

sirplus is a package for the modeling of COVID-19 spread using stochastic individual compartment models (ICMs). The model implemented extends the classical Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model by adding compartments for Exposed, Quarantined, Hospitalised and Case Fatality individuals. The package provides a simple interface for creating experiments to demonstrate how factors like social-distancing and epidemiological parameters will change the curve.
