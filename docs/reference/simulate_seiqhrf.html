compartment is above a hospital capacity level specified by 
hosp.cap, then the fatality rate is the mean of the base fatality 
rate weighted by the hospital capacity, plus a higher rate, 
specified by fat.rate.overcap, weighted by the balance of those 
requiring hospitalisation (but who can't be accommodated). By 
setting fat.rate.overcap higher, the effect of exceeding the 
capacity of the health care system can be simulated. There is also
a coefficient fat.tcoeff for the fatality rates that increases them 
as a linear function of the number of days the individual has been 
in the H compartment. Use of the co-efficient better approximates 
the trapezoid survival time distribution typical of ICU patients.</p></td>
